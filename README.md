# Motivation

We are both huge fans of the popular 2D tower defense game, Arknights. It offers highly addictive gameplay, encouraging players to strategise and plan their defense given the situations in each map. What separates it from other common tower defense games is that it introduces unique elements into gameplay that forces you to think outside the box, juggling limited resources and defending against enemies in a time constraint, while keeping the gameplay fresh and non repetitive. We decided to try our hand at making a tower defense game that also offers this level of enjoyment, delivering an immersive experience for new and experienced tower defense players, while adding our own flair to it.

# Storyline

What began as a peaceful lunch break has erupted into a full-blown lunch time war. You were just about to dig into your lunch, when all of a sudden, hordes of hungry enemies came rushing in. They have a single objective \- to partake in your bowl of Spicy Tartar Chicken Nanban Don. 

But you refuse. And you are not defenseless.

Every second counts. With the allies standing beside you, strategically deploy your towers across the map, be it close quarters or ranged warfare. Every tower matters. Every bite is at stake.

This is the Nanban Requiem.

# Scope

Project Scope  
Nanban Requiem is a 2D top-down tower defense game developed using Godot engine, where the core gameplay revolves around strategically deploying two types of towers: ranged and melee, to defend the base from waves of incoming enemies. 

Description  
Towers serve as the primary defense mechanism, where ranged towers attack enemies from a distance while melee towers block enemy progress and engage in close combat, with a limited block capacity. There will be a cap for the number of towers deployed at any given time to introduce critical thinking involved in understanding the enemy and using the towers’ abilities to one’s advantage.

Enemies consist of both melee and ranged types, navigate a predefined path using a path-following algorithm. Ranged enemies can attack towers or the base from a distance, while melee enemies must reach their target directly.

The win condition is achieved when all enemy waves on the map are cleared. The lose condition occurs if the Base HP is reduced to zero by enemies entering the base.

# Tech Stack

Our game will be developed using the following tools and technologies:

Godot Engine 4.4.1

* A lightweight, open-source game engine used to build our 2D gameplay systems and visuals.

GDScript

* Godot’s built-in scripting language, ideal for rapid prototyping and implementing core game logic.

Git & GitHub

* Used for version control, collaboration, issue tracking, and managing the development process.
