# Orbital 2025 - Spicy Tartar Chicken Nanban Don

**Team ID:** 7366  
**Team Name:** Spicy Tartar Chicken Nanban Don  
**Proposed Level of Achievement:** Apollo 11


## Motivation

As both of us are avid fans of tower defence games, we wanted to try our hand at making one of our own. The motivation behind this tower defense game is to create a highly engaging and challenging gameplay experience for players.


## Aim

We aim to deliver a game that provides deep strategic elements and encourages creative thinking, while offering a fresh challenge with each playthrough.


## User Stories

1. As a player who wants a challenge in a tower defence game, I want to be able to face progressively harder waves of enemies while managing limited resources.  
2. As a player who wants to experience a visually appealing game, I want to see enhanced graphics and animations for towers, enemies, and projectiles that make the gameplay more immersive.


## Features

### Core Features
1. **Map layout**
2. **Enemy pathing**
3. **Enemy and tower classes**
4. **Projectile behaviour and interaction with enemies**
5. **User Interface (UI)**

### Extension Features
6. **Levelling system**
7. **Stage obstacles**
8. **Enemy - Tower interaction** (enemy can attack towers)
9. **Improving sprites and graphics**


## Timeline

### Milestone 1 - Technical proof of concept
- Features 1, 2 base completed (Pathing)
- Feature 3 worked on (basic enemy and towers for testing)
- Feature 4 started on (using what we have from feature 3)

### Milestone 2 - Prototype
- Feature 4 base completed (more projectiles can be added over time)
- Multiple unique classes defined under Feature 3
- Feature 5 completed (basic UI to include functions like pause, restart etc)
- Attempt to add Feature 7 (Obstacles that can block path, damage enemies etc)

### Milestone 3 - Extended system
- Try implementing Feature 8 if possible (by making use of ideas from Feature 7)
- Complete Feature 9
- Implement Feature 6 if possible

## Software Engineering

To achieve our goal of Apollo 11, we plan to implement the following software engineering practices:

1. **Encapsulation**: We will use classes to represent different entities, such as enemies, towers or stage obstacles.  
2. **Inheritance & Polymorphism**: We will create layers of abstraction using inheritance and use polymorphism to define unique methods of attack/movement for each entity.  
3. **Composition**: We will use separate classes and interfaces to define base characteristics such as area of effect, upgrades etc and include them in entity classes.  
4. **Git & GitHub**: We will use Git for version control to manage code and collaborate efficiently, and GitHub will serve as the central repository.  
5. **Code Documentation**: We will write clear, consistent documentation for all code.
